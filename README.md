# Yogi

Yogi is a web app that helps you find the most suitable yoga class for your needs-quickly, simply, and based on your preferences.

---

## How It Works

- We ask you a few questions to get to know your preferences.
- Based on your answers, we match you with one of our classes.
- Before joining, you can preview some content and information about your matched class.

All of this runs on a subdomain of [bekindstudio.at](https://bekindstudio.at).

---

## Features

- **Personalized class recommendations** based on your input.
- **Preview class content** before joining.
- **Data-driven evaluation:** At the end, we (be kind) can analyze how good the recommendation was using internal data.
- **Potential for machine learning** to improve recommendations over time.

---

## Notes

- We use the term **"classes"** instead of "courses".
- Class content and requirements will be provided by the be kind team.
